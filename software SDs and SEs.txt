Software engineer
===========================================================================================
A software engineer is a professional who applies the principles of software engineering for designing, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software.
Question: What are the principles of software engineering

DESIGN --> DEVELOP --> MAINTAIN --> TEST --> EVALUATE

A software engineer is involved in the complete process

Software Engineer is a team activity.

Software Engineer works with other components of the hardware system

Software Engineer creates the tools to develop software. E.g. Visual studio, eclipse

Engineers tend to solve issues on a much larger scale. So, there is not much room left for creative solutions, and instead, they need to be more systematic, and theyâ€™re thinking.

Software developer
===========================================================================================
Software developers are professionals who build software which runs across various types of computer.

Software Developer is primarily a solitary activity. Development is one aspect of the software project building process.

Software Developers write a complete program.


Software Developers use readymade tools to build apps. e.g. desktop apps like Photoshop, mobile apps like instagram, web apps like Facebook, and Twitter

Developers tend to do everything that Engineers do but on a limited scale. This allows them to be more creative than an engineer, coming up with solutions.
