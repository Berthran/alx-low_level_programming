An assembly language is a programming language that communicates with the hardware 
of a computer directly.
An assembler is a program that translates commands into machine code. The assembler 
gathers the instructions from the assembly language and translates each action into
a series of electrical signals the machine can interpret

C is an excellent choice for system programming, for example, developing operating
systems, compilers, and network drivers.

HISTORY OF C
The C programming language was created at Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s, 
mainly by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.
Thompson's first high-level language was named  B after the BCPL system 
programming language on which it was built.
